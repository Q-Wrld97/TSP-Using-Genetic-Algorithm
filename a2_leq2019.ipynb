    "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is about finding the shortest route that visits a list of cities and returns to the starting city. It's a challenging problem with no known fast solution also known as NP-hard, meaning that there is no known polynomial time solution to the problem.However, there are approximate algorithms like the genetic algorithm that can find solutions close to the optimal one such as Ant Colony or Genetic Algorithm. In this project, we will be using the genetic algorithm to solve the TSP problem. The genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic(high-level problem-solving strategies that guide the exploration and exploitation of search spaces to find near-optimal solutions) inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step, the genetic algorithm selects individuals at random from the current population to be parents and uses them to produce the children for the next generation. Over successive generations, the population \"evolves\" toward an optimal solution. Althought there are many variations of the genetic algorithm, they will boil down to these basic step:\n",

    "the original thought was using the single point crossover strategy in which we split the parent genes at a certain point and just do a simple swap which can work for less complex problem like the Knapsack problems or Targeted String Problem but a problem occur in which we will have repeating city in the same solution space thus skewing our fitness function additionally will break our parameter for the problem which dictate that we must travel through all cities. To address the issue of having repeated cities in the same solution space and ensure that all cities are visited, After a bit of research we found (Eric Stoltz) solution which used the Order Crossover (OX) breeding method. This method is specifically designed for permutation-based problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The function performs a random crossover between two parent solutions. It starts by selecting a random range of genes (city numbers) from one parent. The selected genes are then copied to the offspring in the same positions. The remaining genes are filled in the order they appear in the second parent, while ensuring that no duplicates occur. This way, the order of cities is maintained, and all cities are still visited.\n",
